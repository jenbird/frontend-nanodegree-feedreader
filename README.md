# Project Overview

This was project 5 in phase 2 of the Google Udacity Scholarship studying for a Udacity Nanodegree in Front End Web Development.

In this project we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The application had included testing with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and the test suite was started. We had to finish writing the tests in this application.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organisations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

This will ensure I have knowledge of how to work with test-driven development or to use tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features.


## What did I learn?

I learnt how to use Jasmine and how to write a number of unit tests against a pre-existing application. These tested the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


# How to run the application

Download the files locally. Open the index.html file in your chosen browser.
You will see the feedreader. This loads feeds from 4 different sources which can be accessed via the menu.
The Jasmine tests and results are displayed at the end of the page. There are 7 tests in total written in the feedreader.js file. The first test was provided with the project starter files and the additional 6 written in line with the project instructions and rubric.
